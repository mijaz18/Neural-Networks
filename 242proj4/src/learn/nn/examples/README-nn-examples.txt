README for nn.examples

For XOR (AIMA p. 730) and Majority (AIMA p. 731), it is easier to simply generate
the desired number of examples of the functions than to create files of them.

Iris
 - https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris
 - iris.names.txt, iris.data.txt
 - I found a reference somewhere online that this dataset can be learned by an
   NN with four inputs, seven hidden units, and 3 output units (1 output/species).
   YMMV.
 
 MNIST
 - http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/
 - https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/databases/mnist/
 - The LeCun webpage lists several configurations of 2- and 3-layer NNs that
   have been used on this problem, and their accuracy on the test set. For example,
   a 2-layer network with 300, 800, or 1000 hidden units yielding 1.6-4.7% test
   error rate. Again, YMMV (that's life with NNs).
